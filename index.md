## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hey there, my name is Atlas and I'm a tech enthusiast from Scotland. I have recently finished part of a university degree in electrical and mechanical engineering, and have returned to work for a bank who I used to work for a few years ago. 

Outside of work and education, I'm your typical computer loving tech nerd. I'm fascinated with how computers and electronics function, obsessed with cars, love books (especially manga, but the regular kind I enjoy too), enjoy anime, and overall just have all the regular interests a ~90's kid would like skateboarding, Yu-Gi-Oh, and all the other pop hits over the years. 

Here is where I intend to upload projects that I work on in my free time, as I'm intending on learning about the server side of networking and how the backend of systems truly come together and talk to each other. I'm planning on doing this by building servers to fit my needs for self hosting (music, movies, TV shows etc), but I want to expand these horizons and begin to look into proper backend software and services like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and learning languages that stitch them together like Go.
